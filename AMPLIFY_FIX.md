# 🔧 AWS Amplify Fix - RESOLVED

## ✅ **Issue Identified & Fixed**

**Problem**: `cd: frontend: No such file or directory` in AWS Amplify build phase

**Root Cause**: AWS Amplify doesn't persist working directory between build phases

**Solution**: Use combined commands instead of separate cd commands

## 🛠️ **What Changed**

### Before (Broken):

```yaml
preBuild:
  commands:
    - cd frontend
    - npm ci
build:
  commands:
    - cd frontend # ❌ Fails here - back in root directory
    - npm run build
```

### After (Fixed):

```yaml
preBuild:
  commands:
    - cd frontend && npm ci # ✅ Self-contained
build:
  commands:
    - cd frontend && npm run build # ✅ Self-contained
```

## 🚀 **Ready for AWS Amplify**

Your `amplify.yml` is now fixed and should deploy successfully:

1. **Push to GitHub**: `git push origin main`
2. **Deploy to AWS Amplify** - should work now! 🎉

**Status**: ✅ **AWS Amplify deployment issue RESOLVED**
